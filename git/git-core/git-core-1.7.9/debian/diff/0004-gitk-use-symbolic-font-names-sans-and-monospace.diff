Subject: gitk: use symbolic font names "sans" and "monospace"

tk8.5 and later use antialiased fonts (via fontconfig and freetype).
The fonts used by gitk are Helvetica and Courier, which can look
rather bad on screens with antialiasing, especially in the absence of
proper hinting.

It would be best if gitk used sans (which usually is mapped to
Bitstream Vera Sans) for the interface and monospace (usually
Bitstream Vera Mono) for the diff; this way, the local sysadmin can
choose fonts that work well in the local installation once and the
setting will apply to all well-behaved apps.

The appearance of gitk for users that have already used it on a
particular installation will not be affected, since gitk stores the
UI and diff fonts in ~/.gitk.

This patch is intended for Debian experimental for now.  It should
not be applied to sid and upstream until it has been tested against
tk8.4.
