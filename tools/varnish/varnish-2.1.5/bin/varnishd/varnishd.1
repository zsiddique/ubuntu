.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishd daemon accepts HTTP requests from clients, passes them on to a backend server and caches the
returned documents to better satisfy future requests for the same document.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a address[:port][,address[:port][...]
.
Listen for client requests on the specified address and port.  The address can be a host
name (“localhost”), an IPv4 dotted\-quad (“127.0.0.1”), or an IPv6 address enclosed in
square brackets (“[::1]”).  If address is not specified, varnishd will listen on all
available IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.  If port is not specified, the default HTTP port as
listed in /etc/services is used.  Multiple listening addresses and ports can be speci‐
fied as a whitespace\- or comma\-separated list.
.TP
.B \-b host[:port]
.
Use the specified host as backend server.  If port is not specified,
the default is 8080.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C
.
Print VCL code compiled to C language and exit. Specify the VCL file
to compile with the \-f option.
.TP
.B \-d
.
Enables debugging mode: The parent process runs in the foreground with a CLI connection
on stdin/stdout, and the child process must be started explicitly with a CLI command.
Terminating the parent process will also terminate the child.
.TP
.B \-F
.
Run in the foreground.
.TP
.BI \-f \ config
.
Use the specified VCL configuration file instead of the builtin default.  See vcl(7) for
details on VCL syntax.
.TP
.BI \-g \ group
.
Specifies the name of an unprivileged group to which the child process should switch
before it starts accepting connections.  This is a shortcut for specifying the group
run\-time parameter.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h type[,options]
.
Specifies the hash algorithm.  See Hash Algorithms for a list of supported algorithms.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-i \ identity
.
Specify the identity of the varnish server.  This can be accessed using server.identity
from VCL
.TP
.BI \-l \ shmlogsize
.
Specify size of shmlog file.  Scaling suffixes like \(aqk\(aq, \(aqm\(aq can be used up to
(e)tabytes.  Default is 80 Megabytes.  Specifying less than 8 Megabytes is unwise.
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
.
Specify a name for this instance.  Amonst other things, this name is used to construct
the name of the directory in which varnishd keeps temporary files and persistent state.
If the specified name begins with a forward slash, it is interpreted as the absolute
path to the directory which should be used for this purpose.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
.
Write the process\(aqs PID to the specified file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p param=value
.
Set the parameter specified by param to the specified value.  See Run\-Time
Parameters for a list of parameters. This option can be used multiple
times to specify multiple parameters.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-S \ file
.
Path to a file containing a secret used for authorizing access to the management port.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s type[,options]
.
Use the specified storage backend.  See Storage Types for a list of supported storage
types.  This option can be used multiple times to specify multiple storage files.
.TP
.B \-T address[:port]
.
Offer a management interface on the specified address and port.  See Management
Interface for a list of management commands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-t \ ttl
.
Specifies a hard minimum time to live for cached documents.  This is a shortcut for
specifying the default_ttl run\-time parameter.
.TP
.BI \-u \ user
.
Specifies the name of an unprivileged user to which the child
process should switch before it starts accepting
connections.  This is a shortcut for specifying the user
run\- time parameter.
.sp
If specifying both a user and a group, the user should be
specified first.
.TP
.B \-V
.
Display the version number and exit.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-w min[,max[,timeout]]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Start at least min but no more than max worker threads
with the specified idle timeout.  This is a shortcut for
specifying the thread_pool_min, thread_pool_max and
thread_pool_timeout run\-time parameters.
.sp
If only one number is specified, thread_pool_min and
thread_pool_max are both set to this number, and
thread_pool_timeout has no effect.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Hash Algorithms
.sp
The following hash algorithms are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B simple_list
.
A simple doubly\-linked list.  Not recommended for production use.
.TP
.B classic[,buckets]
.
A standard hash table.  This is the default.  The hash key is the
CRC32 of the object\(aqs URL modulo the size of the hash table.  Each
table entry points to a list of elements which share the same hash
key. The buckets parameter specifies the number of entries in the
hash table.  The default is 16383.
.TP
.B critbit
.
A self\-scaling tree structure. The default hash algorithm in 2.1. In
comparison to a more traditional B tree the critbit tree is almost
completely lockless.
.UNINDENT
.SS Storage Types
.sp
The following storage types are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B malloc[,size]
.
Storage for each object is allocated with malloc(3).
.sp
The size parameter specifies the maximum amount of memory varnishd will allocate.  The size is assumed to
be in bytes, unless followed by one of the following suffixes:
.sp
K, k    The size is expressed in kibibytes.
.sp
M, m    The size is expressed in mebibytes.
.sp
G, g    The size is expressed in gibibytes.
.sp
T, t    The size is expressed in tebibytes.
.sp
The default size is unlimited.
.TP
.B file[,path[,size[,granularity]]]
.
Storage for each object is allocated from an arena backed by a file.  This is the default.
.sp
The path parameter specifies either the path to the backing file or the path to a directory in which
varnishd will create the backing file.  The default is /tmp.
.sp
The size parameter specifies the size of the backing file.  The size is assumed to be in bytes, unless fol‐
lowed by one of the following suffixes:
.sp
K, k    The size is expressed in kibibytes.
.sp
M, m    The size is expressed in mebibytes.
.sp
G, g    The size is expressed in gibibytes.
.sp
T, t    The size is expressed in tebibytes.
.sp
%       The size is expressed as a percentage of the free space on the file system where it resides.
.sp
The default size is 50%.
.sp
If the backing file already exists, it will be truncated or expanded to the specified size.
.sp
Note that if varnishd has to create or expand the file, it will not pre\-allocate the added space, leading
to fragmentation, which may adversely impact performance.  Pre\-creating the storage file using dd(1) will
reduce fragmentation to a minimum.
.sp
The granularity parameter specifies the granularity of allocation.  All allocations are rounded up to this
size.  The size is assumed to be in bytes, unless followed by one of the suffixes described for size except
for %.
.sp
The default size is the VM page size.  The size should be reduced if you have many small objects.
.TP
.B persistence[XXX]
.
New, shiny, better.
.UNINDENT
.SS Management Interface
.sp
If the \-T option was specified, varnishd will offer a command\-line management interface on the specified address
and port.  The following commands are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B help [command]
.
Display a list of available commands.
.sp
If the command is specified, display help for this command.
.TP
.B param.set param value
.
Set the parameter specified by param to the specified value.  See Run\-Time Parameters for a list of parame‐
ters.
.TP
.B param.show [\-l] [param]
.
Display a list if run\-time parameters and their values.
.sp
If the \-l option is specified, the list includes a brief explanation of each parameter.
.sp

mentation and examples.
.TP
.B purge.list
.
Display the purge list.
.sp
All requests for objects from the cache are matched against items on the purge list.  If an object in the
cache is older than a matching purge list item, it is considered "purged", and will be fetched from the
backend instead.
.sp
When a purge expression is older than all the objects in the cache, it is removed from the list.
.TP
.B purge.url regexp
.
Immediately invalidate all documents whose URL matches the specified regular expression.

.
Close the connection to the varnish admin port.
.TP
.B start
.
Start the Varnish cache process if it is not already running.
.TP

tinue using whichever configuration was in use when they arrived.
.UNINDENT
.SS Run\-Time Parameters
.sp
Runtime parameters are marked with shorthand flags to avoid repeating the same text over and over in the table
below.  The meaning of the flags are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B experimental
.
We have no solid information about good/bad/optimal values for this parameter.  Feedback with experience
and observations are most welcome.
.TP

.TP
.B restart
.
The worker process must be stopped and restarted, before this parameter takes effect.
.TP
.B reload
.
The VCL programs must be reloaded for this parameter to take effect.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is a list of all parameters, current as of last time we remembered to update the manual page.  This text is
produced from the same text you will find in the CLI if you use the param.show command, so should there be a new
parameter which is not listed here, you can find the description using the CLI commands.
.sp
Be aware that on 32 bit systems, certain default values, such as sess_workspace (=16k) and thread_pool_stack
(=64k) are reduced relative to the values listed here, in order to conserve VM space.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B acceptor_sleep_decay
.
Default: 0.900
Flags: experimental
.sp
If we run out of resources, such as file descriptors or worker threads, the acceptor will sleep between
accepts.
This parameter (multiplicatively) reduce the sleep duration for each succesfull accept. (ie: 0.9 = reduce
by 10%)
.TP
.B acceptor_sleep_incr
.
Units: s
Default: 0.001
Flags: experimental
.sp
If we run out of resources, such as file descriptors or worker threads, the acceptor will sleep between
accepts.
This parameter control how much longer we sleep, each time we fail to accept a new connection.
.TP
.B acceptor_sleep_max
.
Units: s
Default: 0.050
Flags: experimental
.sp
If we run out of resources, such as file descriptors or worker threads, the acceptor will sleep between
accepts.
This parameter limits how long it can sleep between attempts to accept new connections.
.TP
.B auto_restart

Units: bool
Default: on
.sp
Restart child process automatically if it dies.
.TP
.B ban_lurker_sleep
.
Units: s
Default: 0.0
.sp
How long time does the ban lurker thread sleeps between successfull attempts to push the last item up the
purge  list.  It always sleeps a second when nothing can be done.
A value of zero disables the ban lurker.
.TP
.B between_bytes_timeout
.
Units: s
Default: 60
.sp
Default timeout between bytes when receiving data from backend. We only wait for this many seconds between
bytes before giving up. A value of 0 means it will never time out. VCL can override this default value for
each backend request and backend request. This parameter does not apply to pipe.
.TP
.B cache_vbe_conns
.
Units: bool
Default: off
Flags: experimental
.sp
Cache vbe_conn\(aqs or rely on malloc, that\(aqs the question.
.TP

.
Default: exec cc \-fpic \-shared \-Wl,\-x \-o %o %s
Flags: must_reload
.sp
Command used for compiling the C source code to a dlopen(3) loadable object.  Any occurrence of %s in the
string will be replaced with the source file name, and %o will be replaced with the output file name.
.TP
.B cli_buffer
.
Units: bytes
Default: 8192
.sp
Size of buffer for CLI input.
You may need to increase this if you have big VCL files and use the vcl.inline CLI command.
NB: Must be specified with \-p to have effect.
.TP
.B cli_timeout

Units: seconds
Default: 10
.sp
Timeout for the childs replies to CLI requests from the master.
.TP

.sp
How much clockskew we are willing to accept between the backend and our own clock.
.TP
.B connect_timeout
.
Units: s

seconds before giving up. VCL can override this default value for each backend and backend request.
.TP
.B default_grace
.
Default: 10seconds
Flags: delayed
.sp
Default grace period.  We will deliver an object this long after it has expired, provided another thread is
attempting to get a new copy.
.TP
.B default_ttl
.
Units: seconds
Default: 120
.sp
The TTL assigned to objects if neither the backend nor the VCL code assigns one.
Objects already cached will not be affected by changes made until they are fetched from the backend again.
To force an immediate effect at the expense of a total flush of the cache use "purge.url ."

.TP
.B fetch_chunksize
.
Units: kilobytes
Default: 128
Flags: experimental
.sp
The default chunksize used by fetcher. This should be bigger than the majority of objects with short TTLs.
Internal limits in the storage_file module makes increases above 128kb a dubious idea.
.TP
.B first_byte_timeout
.
Units: s
Default: 60
.sp
Default timeout for receiving first byte from backend. We only wait for this many seconds for the first
byte before giving up. A value of 0 means it will never time out. VCL can override this default value for
each backend and backend request. This parameter does not apply to pipe.
.TP
.B group
.
Default: .....
Flags: must_restart
.sp
The unprivileged group to run as.
.TP
.B http_headers
.
Units: header lines
Default: 64
.sp
Maximum number of HTTP headers we will deal with.
This space is preallocated in sessions and workthreads only objects allocate only space for the headers
they store.
.TP
.B http_range
.
Default: off
.sp
Enables experimental support for the HTTP range header, enabling Varnish to serve parts of
an object to a client. However, Varnish will request the whole object from the backend server.
.TP
.B listen_address
.
Default: :80
Flags: must_restart
.sp
Whitespace separated list of network endpoints where Varnish will accept requests.
Possible formats: host, host:port, :port

Flags: must_restart
.sp
Listen queue depth.
.TP
.B log_hashstring
.
Units: bool
Default: off
.sp
Log the hash string to shared memory log.
.TP
.B log_local_address
.
Units: bool
Default: off
.sp
Log the local address on the TCP connection in the SessionOpen shared memory record.
.TP
.B lru_interval
.
Units: seconds
Default: 2
Flags: experimental
.sp
Grace period before object moves on LRU list.
Objects are only moved to the front of the LRU list if they have not been moved there already inside this
timeout period.  This reduces the amount of lock operations necessary for LRU list access.
.TP
.B max_esi_includes
.
Units: includes
Default: 5
.sp
Maximum depth of esi:include processing.
.TP
.B max_restarts
.
Units: restarts
Default: 4
.sp
Upper limit on how many times a request can restart.
Be aware that restarts are likely to cause a hit against the backend, so don\(aqt increase thoughtlessly.
.TP
.B overflow_max
.
Units: %
Default: 100
Flags: experimental
.sp
Percentage permitted overflow queue length.
.sp
This sets the ratio of queued requests to worker threads, above which sessions will be dropped instead of
queued.
.TP
.B ping_interval
.
Units: seconds
Default: 3
Flags: must_restart
.sp
Interval between pings from parent to child.
Zero will disable pinging entirely, which makes it possible to attach a debugger to the child.
.TP
.B pipe_timeout
.
Units: seconds
Default: 60
.sp
Idle timeout for PIPE sessions. If nothing have been received in either direction for this many seconds,
the session is closed.
.TP
.B prefer_ipv6
.
Units: bool
Default: off
.sp
Prefer IPv6 address when connecting to backends which have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.TP
.B purge_dups
.
Units: bool
Default: on
.sp
Detect and eliminate duplicate purges.
.TP
.B rush_exponent
.
Units: requests per request
Default: 3
Flags: experimental
.sp
How many parked request we start for each completed request on the object.
NB: Even with the implict delay of delivery, this parameter controls an exponential increase in number of
worker threads.
.TP
.B saintmode_threshold
.
Units: objects
Default: 10
Flags: experimental
.sp
The maximum number of objects held off by saint mode before no further will be made to the backend until
one times out.  A value of 0 disables saintmode.
.TP
.B send_timeout
.
Units: seconds
Default: 600
Flags: delayed
.sp
Send timeout for client connections. If no data has been sent to the client in this many seconds, the ses‐
sion is closed.
See setsockopt(2) under SO_SNDTIMEO for more information.
.TP
.B sendfile_threshold
.
Units: bytes
Default: \-1
Flags: experimental
.sp
The minimum size of objects transmitted with sendfile.
.TP
.B sess_timeout
.
Units: seconds
Default: 5
.sp
Idle timeout for persistent sessions. If a HTTP request has not been received in this many seconds, the
session is closed.
.TP
.B sess_workspace
.
Units: bytes
Default: 65536
Flags: delayed
.sp
Bytes of HTTP protocol workspace allocated for sessions. This space must be big enough for the entire HTTP
protocol header and any edits done to it in the VCL code.
Minimum is 1024 bytes.
.TP
.B session_linger
.
Units: ms
Default: 50
Flags: experimental
.sp
How long time the workerthread lingers on the session to see if a new request appears right away.
If sessions are reused, as much as half of all reuses happen within the first 100 msec of the previous
request completing.
Setting this too high results in worker threads not doing anything for their keep, setting it too low just
means that more sessions take a detour around the waiter.
.TP
.B session_max
.
Units: sessions
Default: 100000
.sp
Maximum number of sessions we will allocate before just dropping connections.
This is mostly an anti\-DoS measure, and setting it plenty high should not hurt, as long as you have the
memory for it.
.TP
.B shm_reclen
.
Units: bytes
Default: 255
.sp
Maximum number of bytes in SHM log record.
Maximum is 65535 bytes.
.TP
.B shm_workspace
.
Units: bytes
Default: 8192
Flags: delayed
.sp
Bytes of shmlog workspace allocated for worker threads. If too big, it wastes some ram, if too small it
causes needless flushes of the SHM workspace.
These flushes show up in stats as "SHM flushes due to overflow".
Minimum is 4096 bytes.
.TP
.B syslog_cli_traffic
.
Units: bool
Default: on
.sp
Log all CLI traffic to syslog(LOG_INFO).
.TP
.B thread_pool_add_delay
.
Units: milliseconds
Default: 20
Flags: experimental
.sp
Wait at least this long between creating threads.
.sp
Setting this too long results in insuffient worker threads.
.sp
Setting this too short increases the risk of worker thread pile\-up.
.TP
.B thread_pool_add_threshold
.
Units: requests
Default: 2
Flags: experimental
.sp
Overflow threshold for worker thread creation.
.sp
Setting this too low, will result in excess worker threads, which is generally a bad idea.
.sp
Setting it too high results in insuffient worker threads.
.TP
.B thread_pool_fail_delay
.
Units: milliseconds
Default: 200
Flags: experimental
.sp
Wait at least this long after a failed thread creation before trying to create another thread.
.sp
Failure to create a worker thread is often a sign that  the end is near, because the process is running out
of RAM resources for thread stacks.
This delay tries to not rush it on needlessly.
.sp
If thread creation failures are a problem, check that thread_pool_max is not too high.
.sp
It may also help to increase thread_pool_timeout and thread_pool_min, to reduce the rate at which treads
are destroyed and later recreated.
.TP
.B thread_pool_max
.
Units: threads
Default: 500
Flags: delayed, experimental
.sp
The maximum number of worker threads in all pools combined.
.sp
Do not set this higher than you have to, since excess worker threads soak up RAM and CPU and generally just
get in the way of getting work done.
.TP
.B thread_pool_min
.
Units: threads
Default: 5
Flags: delayed, experimental
.sp
The minimum number of threads in each worker pool.
.sp
Increasing this may help ramp up faster from low load situations where threads have expired.
.sp
Minimum is 2 threads.
.TP
.B thread_pool_purge_delay
.
Units: milliseconds
Default: 1000
Flags: delayed, experimental
.sp
Wait this long between purging threads.
.sp
This controls the decay of thread pools when idle(\-ish).
.sp
Minimum is 100 milliseconds.
.TP
.B thread_pool_stack
.
Units: bytes
Default: \-1
Flags: experimental
.sp
Worker thread stack size.  In particular on 32bit systems you may need to tweak this down to fit many
threads into the limited address space.
.TP
.B thread_pool_timeout
.
Units: seconds
Default: 300
Flags: delayed, experimental
.sp
Thread idle threshold.
.sp
Threads in excess of thread_pool_min, which have been idle for at least this long are candidates for purg‐
ing.
.sp
Minimum is 1 second.
.TP
.B thread_pools
.
Units: pools
Default: 2
Flags: delayed, experimental
.sp
Number of worker thread pools.
.sp
Increasing number of worker pools decreases lock contention.
.sp
Too many pools waste CPU and RAM resources, and more than one pool for each CPU is probably detrimal to
performance.
.sp
Can be increased on the fly, but decreases require a restart to take effect.
.TP
.B thread_stats_rate
.
Units: requests
Default: 10
Flags: experimental
.sp
Worker threads accumulate statistics, and dump these into the global stats counters if the lock is free
when they finish a request.
This parameters defines the maximum number of requests a worker thread may handle, before it is forced to
dump its accumulated stats into the global counters.
.TP
.B user  Default: .....
.
Flags: must_restart
.sp
The unprivileged user to run as.  Setting this will also set "group" to the specified user\(aqs primary group.
.TP
.B vcl_trace
.
Units: bool
Default: off
.sp
Trace VCL execution in the shmlog.
Enabling this will allow you to see the path each request has taken through the VCL program.
This generates a lot of logrecords so it is off by default.
.TP
.B waiter
.
Default: default
Flags: must_restart, experimental
.sp
Select the waiter kernel interface.

.SS Purge expressions
.sp
A purge expression consists of one or more conditions.  A condition consists of a field, an operator, and an
argument.  Conditions can be ANDed together with "&&".
.sp
A field can be any of the variables from VCL, for instance req.url, req.http.host or obj.set\-cookie.
.sp
Operators are "==" for direct comparision, "~" for a regular expression match, and ">" or "<" for size compar‐
isons.  Prepending an operator with "!" negates the expression.
.sp
The argument could be a quoted string, a regexp, or an integer.  Integers can have "KB", "MB", "GB" or "TB"
appended for size related fields.
.sp
Simple example: All requests where req.url exactly matches the string /news are purged from the cache::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
req.url == "/news"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Example: Purge all documents where the name does not end with ".ogg", and where the size of the object is greater
than 10 megabytes::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
req.url !~ "\e.ogg$" && obj.size > 10MB
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Example: Purge all documents where the serving host is "example.com" or "www.example.com", and where the Set\-
Cookie header received from the backend contains "USERID=1663"::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
req.http.host ~ "^(www\e.)example.com$" && obj.set\-cookie ~ "USERID=1663"
.ft P
.fi
