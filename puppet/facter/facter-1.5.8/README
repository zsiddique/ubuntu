This package is largely meant to be a library for collecting facts about your
system.  These facts are mostly strings (i.e., not numbers), and are things
like the output of 'uname', public ssh and cfengine keys, the number of
processors, etc.

See bin/facter for an example of the interface.

See http://reductivelabs.com/projects/facter/ for more details.
