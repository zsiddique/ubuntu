This is the main puppet client\. Its job is to retrieve the local machine\'s configuration from a remote server and apply it\. In order to successfully communicate with the remote server, the client must have a certificate signed by a certificate authority that the server trusts; the recommended method for this, at the moment, is to run a certificate authority as part of the puppet server (which is the default)\. The client will connect and request a signed certificate, and will continue connecting until it receives one\.
.
.P
Once the client has a signed certificate, it will retrieve its configuration and apply it\.+puppet agent+ does its best to find a compromise between interactive use and daemon use\. Run with no arguments and no configuration, it will go into the backgroun, attempt to get a signed certificate, and retrieve and apply its configuration every 30 minutes\.
.
.P
Some flags are meant specifically for interactive use \-\- in particular, +test+, +tags+ or +fingerprint+ are useful\. +test+ enables verbose logging, causes the daemon to stay in the foreground, exits if the server\'s configuration is invalid (this happens if, for instance, you\'ve left a syntax error on the server), and exits after running the configuration once (rather than hanging around as a long\-running process)\.
.
.P
+tags+ allows you to specify what portions of a configuration you want to apply\. Puppet elements are tagged with all of the class or definition names that contain them, and you can use the +tags+ flag to specify one of these names, causing only configuration elements contained within that class or definition to be applied\. This is very useful when you are testing new configurations \-\- for instance, if you are just starting to manage +ntpd+, you would put all of the new elements into an +ntpd+ class, and call puppet with +\-\-tags ntpd+, which would only apply that small portion of the configuration during your testing, rather than applying the whole thing\.
.
.P
+fingerprint+ is a one\-time flag\. In this mode +puppet agent+ will run once and display on the console (and in the log) the current certificate (or certificate request) fingerprint\. Providing the +\-\-digest+ option allows to use a different digest algorithm to generate the fingerprint\. The main use is to verify that before signing a certificate request on the master, the certificate request the master received is the same as the one the client sent (to prevent against man\-in\-the\-middle attacks when signing certificates)\.Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'server\' is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-server \fIservername\fR\' as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at http://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet agent with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.

                there were failures during the transaction\. This

                lock file in place, causing +puppet agent+ not to

                This is useful if you are testing a configuration
                and do not want the central configuration to
                override the local state until everything is tested
                and committed\.
