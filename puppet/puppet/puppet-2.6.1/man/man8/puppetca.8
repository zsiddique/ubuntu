Because the puppetmasterd daemon defaults to not signing client certificate requests, this script is available for signing outstanding requests\. It can be used to list outstanding requests and then either sign them individually or sign all of them\.Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir \fIdirectory\fR\' as an argument\.
.

See the configuration file documentation at http://reductivelabs\.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet cert with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.
