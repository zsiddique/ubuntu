This file explains some details about developing the Augeas C library.

Check out the sources
---------------------

The sources are in a git repo (which you presumably found already)

  git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/augeas.git

Building from git
-----------------

  Besides the usual build tools (gcc, autoconf, automake etc.) you need the
  following tools and libraries to build Augeas:

    * Bison
    * Flex
    * readline-devel
    * libselinux-devel (optional)

  Augeas uses gnulib, and you need a checkout of gnulib. The build scripts
  can create a checkout for you behind the scenes - though if you already
  have a gnulib checkout, you can pass its location to autogen.sh with the
  --gnulib-srcdir option.

  At its simplest, you build Augeas from git by running the following
  commands in the toplevel directory of your Augeas checkout:

    ./autogen.sh [--gnulib-srcdir=$GNULIB_CHECKOUT]
    make && make install

  It is recommended though to turn on a few development features when
  building; in particular, stricter compiler warnings and some debug
  logging. You can pass these options either to autogen.sh or to
  configure. You'd then run autogen like this:

    ./autogen.sh --enable-compile-warnings=error --enable-debug=yes
