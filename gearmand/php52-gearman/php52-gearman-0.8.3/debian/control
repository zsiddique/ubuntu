Description: gearman extension module for PHP
 Gearman is a system to farm out work to other machines, dispatching function
 calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel,
 to load balance lots of function calls, or to call functions between languages.
 .
 The Gearman PHP Extension provides a wrapper to libgearman. This
 gives the user the ability to write fully featured Gearman clients
 and workers in PHP, allowing them to quickly develop distributed
 applications.
