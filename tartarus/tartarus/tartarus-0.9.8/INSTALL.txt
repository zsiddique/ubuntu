Tartarus - a flexible script based backup system

by Stefan Tomanek <stefan.tomanek+tartarus@wertarbyte.de>

Thanks for downloading and extracting the tartarus package.  Since you are
reading this, you for some reason refrained from taking the easy (and
recommended) road of downloading a Debian package and be done with it.

If you are running a debian based distribution, please consider turning back
and fetching a readily prepared package from http://wertarbyte.de/apt/

This document describes the manual installation procedure of the tartarus
suite, which consists of three separate components.

1. the tartarus script: bin/tartarus

The central script of the suite is a shell script, so it does not require
any compilation or other preparation. It is sufficient to copy the file
to a location within your path, e.g. /usr/local/sbin

2. the charon programs and libraries: bin/charon* and lib/*

Charon, which is an optional script to remove expired backup archives from your
storage is a Perl script and consists of a set of scripts and a perl module.
While the scripts can be placed alongside tartarus in /usr/local/sbin, the Perl
module has to be copied to a place the Perl interpreter can find it.  You can
check the locations Perl looks for modules by typing "perl -V".  For users of
Perl 5.10 it might be possible to copy the direcory lib/Tartarus (which
contains the modules inside the correct directory structure) to
/usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/, but you probably need to verify that location.

3. the manual pages: man/*

All documentation of tartarus and charon is ancapsulated in appropiate
manpages.  The Makefile supplied in this archive takes care of their
generation, the command "make" should place them in the directory man/.  The
files can be copied to the directory /usr/local/share/man/man1/ for easy
access.
